## Description
{Nowadays, we are witnessing a “Just Transition” of fossil fuel workers into emerging green jobs. However, job polarization is widely observed to become a major concern in many societies. Occupations are differentiating into high wage occupations and low wage occupations, requiring distinct skill sets. As a result, mobility for workers between high wage occupations and low wage occupations is constrained. In our “Just Transitions”, this type of difficulties could also be encountered by workers in fossil fuel jobs when adapting to green jobs. We examine this as skill barriers and try to analyze the barriers using the correlation between our derived occupations’ similarity scores and the number of job transitions in a resume dataset. We present this as a novel way to study the skill barriers between jobs requiring distinct skill sets.
